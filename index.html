    <h2> Where and how should I train for ANW? </h2>
       <p class = "training"> There are many gyms across the country and ways to train at home  <a href= "http://www.mudrunguide.com/" target= "_blank"> mudrunguide.com </a> is a great website to search for gyms near you. Buying a pull up bar could be a good option because building up grip and arm strength is very important. Buying ninja holds from somewhere like <a href= "http://www.atomikclimbingholds.com/" target= "_blank"> atomicclimbingholds.com </a> or <a href="https://monstro.ninja" target="_blank"> monstro.ninja</a> could be options but you can also try to make some on your own. Working on overall fitness is very helpful as well as core and endurance. Simple workouts like lunge jumps, push ups and pull ups (wide grip or narrow) are great for at home workouts. Rock climbing is a great sport to get into if there isn't a ninja gym near you, or if you want to mix it up. </p>
